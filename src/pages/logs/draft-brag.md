## The Why/What

I've never been great at talking about my accomplishments at work. I prefer to be out of the spotlight. But I've often felt like I wasn't valued at work and my contributions weren't being seen. The best way for me to feel valued is to show my value - which means talking about myself. So it was time to hit the books and learn how to talk about myself and my accomplishments without feeling sleazy.

## The How

- "Brag Better" by Meredith Fineman

## Lessons Learned

- Part of bragging is elevating the voices of those around you, both by sharing the accomplishments of those who deserve recognition and by inspiring others to speak up
  - I've always been more focused on elevating others than my own goals and growth, and reframing bragging to include it as a way of lifting others is very meaningful to me
- We trust the loudest voices because they are the only voices we hear. To drown out the loud voices (and get more variety of knowledge/experience), we need the quiet voices to speak up.
- A lot of past experiences and environmental conditions make us hesitant to brag. But we have to do it anyway. The only way for people to see you as who you are, not who they think you are or who they expect you to be, is to speak up and tell them who you are and what you've done.
  - This is particularly poignant for me. In the past, I've been given negative labels by people in my work life (the two that stuck with me the most are "inflexible" and "bringing the team down"). But that's not who I am - I am someone who wants everyone around me to succeed and will do whatever I can to make that happen. Having this negative narrative around me has held me back in my career, and if I want that to change (and I do!), I need to be better about getting over my fears and selling myself (aka bragging).
- Stick to the facts when bragging (don't use a lot of adjectives or superlatives), and don't compare yourself to others in your brags. Don't fluff or sugarcoat - just say what you mean.
- Using the phrases "shameless plug" and "humblebrag" before bragging about your accomplishments is a way of undercutting yourself - if shows that you're not comfortable with the brag.
- You may encounter backlash when you brag or speak loudly, but that shouldn't make you afraid to speak up. More often than not, when you speak up, you will see improvements in your work life and in recognition of your accomplishments.
- If you want to be recognized for a particular part of your work, even if it's not what you do most often, mention that work first when talking about your work/experience. Describe yourself not just as who you are but who you want to be.
- Practice! Practice! Practice! Practice your brags, practice introductions ... basically, anything you're going to say about yourself, practice it first.
