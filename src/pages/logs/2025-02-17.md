## The Why/What

I've never been great at talking about my accomplishments at work. I prefer to be out of the spotlight. But I've often felt like I wasn't valued at work and my contributions weren't being seen. The best way for me to feel valued is to show my value - which means talking about myself. So it was time to hit the books and learn how to talk about myself and my accomplishments without sounding (or feeling) arrogant.

## The How

- I read ["Brag Better" by Meredith Fineman](https://www.meredithfineman.com/brag-better)

## Lessons Learned

- Part of bragging is elevating the voices of those around you, both by sharing the accomplishments of those who deserve recognition and by inspiring others to speak up. It's important to remember that there's room for everyone to brag.
- We trust the loudest voices because they are the only voices we hear. To drown out the loud voices (and get more variety of knowledge/experience), we need the quiet voices to speak up.
- A lot of past experiences and environmental conditions make us hesitant to brag. But we have to do it anyway. If you want to be recognized for a particular part of your work, even if it's not what you do most often, mention that work first when talking about your work/experience. The only way for people to see you as who you are and who you want to be is to tell that story and focus on the accomplishments that most align with your vision for yourself.
- Stick to the facts when bragging (don't use a lot of adjectives or superlatives), and don't compare yourself to others in your brags. Don't fluff or sugarcoat - just say what you mean. Avoid phrases like "shameless plug" and "humblebrag", which indicate that you're not comfortable bragging.
- You may encounter backlash when you brag or speak loudly, but that shouldn't make you afraid to speak up. More often than not, when you speak up, you will see improvements in your work life and in recognition of your accomplishments. Take criticism seriously when it comes from people you trust, especially if you're getting the same feedback from multiple people. Ignore criticism from the peanut gallery or that you know doesn't come from a good place.
- Practice! Practice! Practice! Practice your brags, practice introductions ... basically, anything you're going to say about yourself, practice it first. Make sure you have a consistent message and you're comfortable sharing it.
- Your first brag is a win (as are all bragging milestones). Celebrate the win!
- **Be proud of yourself and the work you have done. Brag because you can, because so many in the world cannot. Use your privilege to elevate the voices of those who may not have your privilege or platform. Brag to have your voice and your values heard.**

## What's Next

- There are some exercises in the book that I skimmed through on my first read that I want to go back and focus on, to ensure that I truly understand why I'm bragging, what I want to achieve from my brags (and my career), and how to best craft my brags to achieve these goals.
- Look for opportunities to encourage others to brag! When we lift others, we all benefit ("a rising tide lifts all boats" or whatever that expression is). I won't be satisfied just bragging about myself and leaving it there - I want to see those around me get the kudos they deserve.
