## The Why/What

In my next job, I'm going to be doing fullstack development. While I've done some backend/fullstack in the past and have used Express, I don't feel quite as comfortable with it as I do with React. So it's time to dig in, learn more about express, and start writing some REST APIs. Growth time!

## The How

Because I'm pretty comfortable with my React knowledge (and also HTML/CSS), I didn't want to go through a full crash course on web development. I mostly only needed the backend parts. So I looked for YouTube tutorials that focused on Express. There are a lot of videos for beginners out there, and I watched two of them.

### YouTube tutorials

- From Web Dev Simplified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0
  - Waring: This video has many ads (which is annoying)
  - ... but it's an excellent intro to the basics (and not-so-basics)
- From Smoljames: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BD9eK9VqXA
  - This is a very detailed look at backend development - way more detail than I needed about how the web works (it's geared towards beginners), so I listened to a decent chunk of it at 1.75x speed (of course, 1.75x speed meant I got ads 1.75 times as often)
  - I liked this course because it broke things down into steps and felt like it covered a lot. It also touched on databases and ORMs a bit, which is an area that I will need to dig into more as a I start my new role.

## Lessons Learned

- I actually mostly remember how to use Express! Once I got to my second or third practice app I was writing code ahead of the tutorials
- Express allows a lot of flexibility when creating a REST API
- Express has a robust ecosystem of middleware available to help with more complex use cases
- I'm excited to get back into using Express!

## What's Next

- Databases and database design - I am hoping to use some of my L&D budget for this
- Best practices for enterprise REST APIs
