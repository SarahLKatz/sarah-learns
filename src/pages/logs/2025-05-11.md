## The Why/What

- I've recently started using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en), an AI-powered IDE, for some of my coding at work.
- I started using it when a teammate shared an experience writing code with Cursor, and went all-in on trying it during our recent hackathon.

## The How

- I'm fortunate that my company was able to provide licenses through a company team, meaning that I was able to write my code in private mode without having to pay anything out of my own pocket.

## Lessons Learned

- Be very specific with your prompts and provide context when you can.
  - If you just tell cursor "write me a component" or "write me a test", it doesn't know what your business needs or codebase best practices are and will write based on what it knows. Which may not work for what you need.
  - But if you tell it "write a component to display a `BlueSettingsPage`, which should be similar to `@OrangeSettingsPage.tsx` but using all of the blue colors from `@component-library/colors`", that will be much closer to what you need.
- It's good for scaffolding, but code will need some massaging. Even given a lot of context, sometimes you will still need to tweak the code a bit. Understand that Cursor code may not be production code, but it can be the first step on the way there.
- Tab to autocomplete can be good but can also sometimes add things you don't want and have negative consequences
  - I have had tab add hidden special characters that shouldn't be there and spaces that shouldn't be there. I've also had it suggest things that just didn't fit what I needed.
  - I think autocomplete is the part that I wanted to like the most but ended up liking the least. It helps sometimes, but most of the time it feels like more trouble than it's worth.

## Conclusion

- I didn't hate the experience, but I didn't love it. I'd say I'm solidly in the middle. Vibe coding is not for me, but I like having AI make my work a little easier.
- Cursor will definitely not replace VS Code as my main work IDE, but I am still using for a few things:
  - To help me get started on tasks in areas of the code where I'm not super comfortable (for example, I had it update some SQL for me last week)
  - To scaffold test files - I usually ask it to write out a list of things it would test, then edit it down to just the things that I think need to be tested. Once I have that list, I either write the tests on my own or write them with Cursor's help.
  - To write additional tests once I've already written the first test - if, for example, I'm testing how a component renders given different data, once I have the first test passing, Cursor can quickly write tests for the rest of the data conditions, and it's almost always correct
