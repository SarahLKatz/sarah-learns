## The Why/What

With some time off after my separation from my last job, I've decided to dedicate time to learning new tech that I haven't gotten to use yet. I had heard about a static site generator called Astro, and I decided to check it out and see how I like it!

## The How

- Over the course of a few days, I went through the blog tutorial on Astro's website, coding along with every step
- I'm reinforcing that learning by building this blog!

## Lessons Learned

- Working with Astro is actually pretty simple, once you learn how the frontmatter works and can be used to help you
- If I want to move forward with a learning log (something I've wanted to do for a bit), Astro is a good framework to use to build it
- While I'm building a learning log, I might as well also make a bit of a personal website
