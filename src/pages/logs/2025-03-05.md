## The Why/What

- As part of the project I'm working on (at work), I need to update a backend endpoint to receive/parse some new types of data. A teammate used zod to validate some similar data, and suggested I do the same. I haven't used Zod before, so it was time to learn!
- Zod: [https://zod.dev/](https://zod.dev/)

## The How

- Reading through my teammate's code
- Zod documentation: [https://zod.dev/?id=basic-usage](https://zod.dev/?id=basic-usage)

## Lessons Learned

- I can use `z.coerce` to coerce values to a primitive type if that's what I need them to be. For more control over the coercion logic, `z.preprocess` or `z.pipe()` may be more useful.
- There are a variety of methods available to validate date and/or time (which will be useful in my case, as a few of the fields I'm validating are dates)
- Adding `.partial()` to a schema makes all top-level properties optional (similar to Typescript's `Partial`). `.deepPartial()` does this for all levels of the schema (useful if you have a lot of nested objects where all properties should be optional). The opposite of partial is `.required()`.
- You can create custom Zod schema (to match your Typescript objects) using `z.custom()`. This method accepts an optional validation function (with no validation function, anything will pass).
- `.parse()` will return a deep clone of the passed-in variable if validation passes and throws an error if the validation fails. `.safeParse()` does not throw an error if validation fails - it returns either the parsed data or a `ZodError` instance, which has information about the validation.
  - Fun fact: the validations I wrote in my (work) code are using `.safeParse`
- While the methods listed above are the ones I see myself using most often, Zod has a lot of methods to cover a variety of use cases - I can see who some people find it super useful! I'm glad I'm using this to help with validation for my project.
